# Realtime WhiteBoard
- Created a realtime WhiteBoard built using Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- I has features like: Pencil with different colours, eraser with sizes, sticky notes, sticky images and download boards.
- Used Socket.io and Node events to reflect back realtime changes to multiple users.
